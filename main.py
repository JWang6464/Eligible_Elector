Assignment: Voter Eligibility Checker
Part of the Cognizant Externship Program

This script prompts the user to enter their age and checks if they are eligible to vote.
If the user is 18 or older, it prints a congratulatory message.
If the user is under 18, it calculates how many years are left until eligibility and displays a friendly message.
