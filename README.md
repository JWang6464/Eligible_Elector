# Eligible Elector

This is a short Python script that checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age. If the user is under 18, it tells them how many years they have left. If they’re 18 or older, it encourages them to make their voice count.

## How It Works

The program:
- Prompts the user to enter their age
- Checks if the user is 18 or older
- Prints a message based on their eligibility

## Example
How old are you? 16
Oops! You’re not eligible yet. But hey, only 2 more years to go!

How old are you? 20
Congratulations! You are eligible to vote. Go make a difference!

## Purpose

This was created as part of the Cognizant externship program. The goal was to practice basic conditionals, input handling, and writing clear, user-friendly output.

## How to Run
Make sure you're using Python 3, then run: python main.py OR python3 main.py
